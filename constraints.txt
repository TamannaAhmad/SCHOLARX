# Constraints file to exclude pyarrow
# pyarrow causes build failures on Netlify with Python 3.14
# This constraint prevents pyarrow from being installed
# If a package requires pyarrow, pip will fail - but pyarrow is not needed for backend
# Note: This may cause installation to fail if a package explicitly requires pyarrow
# In that case, we need to identify and remove/update the package requiring it
pyarrow==0.0.0
